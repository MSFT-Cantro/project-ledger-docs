## 💡 Key Updates

### 📋 Streamlined Change Order Editing

We redesigned the change order interface to be faster and cleaner. Same powerful functionality, just easier to use.

**What's better:**
- Edit change orders in half the time with the improved layout
- Consistent design that matches your quotes and invoices
- Works great on mobile—update changes right from the job site
- Clearer navigation and better form organization

**Real-world use:**  
Client wants to add work while you're on-site? Open the change order on your phone, add the items, and send for approval—all in under a minute.

### 📱 Mobile-Optimized Interface

Your phone is now a better tool for running your business. We optimized the entire app for mobile devices.

**Improvements:**
- More screen space for the information that matters
- Easier to tap buttons and forms (even with gloves)
- Faster page loads on mobile networks
- Text stays readable without zooming

**Real-world use:**  
Show clients quotes at their property, review invoices on-site, or check project details between jobs—all from your phone with a professional-looking interface.

### 📄 Contract Terms Templates

Seven pre-built contract templates covering payment terms, warranties, change procedures, liability, delays, materials, and dispute resolution.

**Why it matters:**
- Save time—no more writing terms from scratch
- Protect your business with professional legal language
- Customize templates to match your business needs
- Attach to quotes, contracts, and invoices automatically

**Real-world use:**  
New client questions your payment schedule? Include your "Payment Terms" template in the quote. Clear, professional, no confusion.
