## ✨ What's New## ✨ Overview



We've rolled out ProjectLedger v1.6.0 with three key improvements designed to make your contracting business run smoother—whether you're in the office or on the job site.Running a contracting business means wearing a lot of hats. You're on job sites, meeting with clients, managing crews, and handling paperwork—often all in the same day. You need tools that work as hard as you do, whether you're in the office or out in the field.



---That's why we're excited to release ProjectLedger v1.6.0, packed with improvements that make your daily workflow faster, easier, and more professional.



## 💡 Key UpdatesThis release focuses on three key areas: making change orders even better to use, ensuring the app works great on any device (especially your phone), and giving you powerful contract templates to protect your business.



### 📋 Streamlined Change Order EditingWe've streamlined the change order editing experience so you can update project modifications in seconds. We've optimized the mobile interface so you can review quotes and invoices on-site without squinting. And we've added professional contract terms templates so you're covered on every job.



We redesigned the change order interface to be faster and cleaner. Same powerful functionality, just easier to use.No more clunky interfaces. No more zooming in and out on your phone. No more scrambling to write contract terms from scratch. Just smooth, professional tools that help you get the job done.
