🚀 ProjectLedger v1.6.0 — Work Faster, Work Smarter, Work Anywhere

Release Date: October 15, 2025  
Version: 1.6.0

---

## ✨ Overview

Running a contracting business means wearing a lot of hats. You're on job sites, meeting with clients, managing crews, and handling paperwork—often all in the same day. You need tools that work as hard as you do, whether you're in the office or out in the field.

That's why we're excited to release ProjectLedger v1.6.0, packed with improvements that make your daily workflow faster, easier, and more professional.

This release focuses on three key areas: making change orders even better to use, ensuring the app works great on any device (especially your phone), and giving you powerful contract templates to protect your business.

We've streamlined the change order editing experience so you can update project modifications in seconds. We've optimized the mobile interface so you can review quotes and invoices on-site without squinting. And we've added professional contract terms templates so you're covered on every job.

No more clunky interfaces. No more zooming in and out on your phone. No more scrambling to write contract terms from scratch. Just smooth, professional tools that help you get the job done.

## 💡 What's New

## 📋 Streamlined Change Order Editing
Update project changes faster than ever

Remember when we launched Change Orders in v1.5.0? You loved the ability to document scope changes professionally. Now we've made editing those change orders even better.

We completely redesigned the change order editing interface with a focus on speed and consistency. The new layout matches your quote and invoice workflows, so everything feels familiar. Navigation is clearer, forms are more intuitive, and the whole process just flows better.

**Why you'll love it:**
- **Lightning Fast Updates** — Edit change orders in half the time with our streamlined interface
- **Consistent Experience** — Same branded layout across all change order screens
- **No More Confusion** — Clear labels, logical flow, and better organization of information
- **Mobile Friendly** — Edit change orders from your phone on the job site

**How it works:**
1. Open any change order from your Change Orders list or project page
2. Click "Edit" to enter the new streamlined editing mode
3. Make your changes with the improved form layout
4. Save and send to your client for approval

**Real-world example:**  
You're on a job site and the client wants to add an extra room to the renovation. Open the change order on your phone, add the new items, calculate the cost increase, and send for approval—all while standing in the space. No need to wait until you're back at the office.

## 📱 Mobile-First Design Improvements
Your job site just became your office

Contractors work on the go. You're meeting clients at properties, checking on crews, and reviewing project details in the field. You shouldn't have to wait until you're back at your desk to access critical information.

We've optimized the main application layout to work better on phones and tablets. More screen space for the content that matters. Smoother scrolling. Better touch targets. Cleaner navigation. Everything sized perfectly for mobile devices.

**Why it matters:**
- **More Screen Real Estate** — Optimized layout shows more information without feeling cramped
- **Easier Navigation** — Better spacing and larger touch targets work great with gloves on
- **Responsive Design** — Automatically adapts to your phone, tablet, or desktop
- **Professional Look** — Impress clients when reviewing quotes and invoices on-site

**What's improved:**
- Main content area uses space more efficiently
- Navigation menus work better on smaller screens
- Forms and buttons are easier to tap accurately
- Text remains readable without zooming
- Pages load faster on mobile networks

**Real-world example:**  
A client asks to see the quote while you're at their property. Pull out your phone, open ProjectLedger, and walk them through the entire quote right there. The clean mobile interface makes you look professional and keeps the conversation moving.

## 📄 Contract Terms & Conditions Templates (Phase 2)
Protect your business on every job

Every contractor knows: good contracts protect everyone. Clear terms prevent disputes, manage client expectations, and give you legal protection when things go sideways.

But writing contract terms from scratch? That takes time you don't have. And using generic terms you found online? That's risky.

ProjectLedger v1.6.0 introduces a professional Terms & Conditions system with a library of contractor-focused templates. We've included standard terms for payment schedules, change procedures, warranties, liability, and more. Use them as-is or customize them for your specific business.

**Why you'll love it:**
- **Pre-Built Templates** — Seven professional templates covering common contracting scenarios
- **Customizable** — Modify templates to match your business policies and local requirements
- **Reusable** — Save your customized terms and use them across multiple projects
- **Professional Protection** — Written by professionals, covering the issues that matter

**What's included:**

**Standard Templates:**
1. **Payment Terms** — Deposits, progress payments, final payment procedures
2. **Change Order Procedures** — How scope changes are handled and approved
3. **Warranty Terms** — What's covered, for how long, and what's excluded
4. **Liability Limitations** — Protect yourself from unreasonable claims
5. **Project Delays** — Weather, material shortages, and other delay clauses
6. **Material Specifications** — Quality standards and substitution policies
7. **Dispute Resolution** — Mediation and arbitration procedures

**How it works:**
1. Access the Terms & Conditions library from your settings
2. Browse pre-built templates or create your own
3. Customize terms to match your business practices
4. Attach terms to quotes, contracts, and invoices
5. Include them automatically in your PDF documents

**Real-world example:**  
A new client questions your payment schedule. Instead of explaining it verbally (and hoping they remember), you include your "Payment Terms" template in the quote. It clearly spells out deposit requirements, progress payments, and final payment procedures. No confusion, no disputes—just professional documentation.
