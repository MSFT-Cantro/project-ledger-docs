## 💡 What's New

### 🏢 Multi-Organization Support

One Login. Multiple Businesses. Zero Confusion.

You can now belong to multiple organizations and seamlessly switch between them. Each organization maintains its own completely separate workspace with its own clients, projects, invoices, and team.

**Why you'll love it:**
- **Effortless Switching** — Quick dropdown in your navigation bar lets you jump between organizations instantly
- **Smart Experience** — Single-org users see no change (it just works); multi-org users get a beautiful selector after login
- **Complete Isolation** — Each organization's data stays completely separate and secure
- **No More Logout Hassles** — Stop logging in and out to switch between businesses

**How it works:**
- Single organization? You're automatically taken straight to your dashboard — just like before
- Multiple organizations? Choose which one you want to work with after login
- Switch anytime using the organization dropdown in your navigation bar
- Your current organization always shows clearly so you know exactly where you are

### 📋 Smarter Invoice Creation

From Quote to Invoice — Your Way

Creating invoices from quotes just got a lot more flexible. You can now select exactly which items from a quote should be included in your invoice.

**Why it matters:**
- **Partial Invoicing** — Bill for completed work while leaving future phases on the quote
- **Better Control** — Cherry-pick specific items instead of all-or-nothing
- **Cleaner Workflow** — Less manual editing after invoice creation
- **Faster Turnaround** — Get invoices out the door when work is done, not when the entire quote is complete

### 🎨 Cleaner Interface

Less Clutter, More Focus

We've refined the interface to be even cleaner and more focused on your work. The notification button now lives exclusively in your toolbar where it belongs.

**What changed:**
- Removed the persistent floating button that could get in the way
- Single, consistent notification access in your toolbar
- Cleaner screen space for your actual work
- Same great notifications, better placement

## ⚙️ Behind the Scenes

**Highlights:**
- **Zero Breaking Changes** — Single-org users experience no workflow changes

- **Production Ready** — All critical data seeded and verified
