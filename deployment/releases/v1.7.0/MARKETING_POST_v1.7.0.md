 💡 Key Updates

 📝 Unified Quotes & Estimates System

One platform to create quotes, convert to estimates with contingencies, and track everything through project completion.

What you get:
- Professional quote creation with line items and pricing
- Estimate generation with built-in contingency support
- Convert quotes to estimates (or estimates back to quotes) in one click
- Type-specific filtering and list views
- Client portal access for estimates

Real-world use:  
Client asks for a quote? Create it in minutes. They want a detailed estimate with contingency? Convert the quote instantly and add your buffer. They see it in their portal and can approve online.

---

 📄 Professional PDF Generation

Every quote and estimate generates a polished PDF automatically—ready to send or download.

Why it matters:
- Consistent, professional-looking documents every time
- Match your brand with standardized formatting
- Email directly or save for records
- No more manual document creation in Word or Excel

Real-world use:  
Finish a quote on-site, generate the PDF, and email it before you leave the property. Client gets it while you're still top of mind.

 🔄 Change Order Support for Estimates

Change orders now work with estimates, not just invoices. Track scope changes from estimate phase through project completion.

Improvements:
- Create change orders against estimates
- Full lifecycle management for project changes
- Maintain accurate project scope documentation
- Seamless workflow from estimate to final billing

Real-world use:  
Client wants to add work after approving the estimate? Create a change order, link it to the estimate, get approval, and keep your documentation clean.

---

 👥 Client Portal Integration

Your clients can now view and interact with estimates through their portal—just like they do with invoices.

What's included:
- Clients see all their estimates in one place
- Clean, professional presentation
- No logins or complicated systems for you to manage
- Better client experience = faster approvals

Real-world use:  
Send estimate notification to client. They log into their portal, review the details, and approve—all without a single phone call or email back-and-forth.

---

 🔒 Enhanced Security

Added authentication and authorization improvements across admin, metrics, and change order endpoints.

Security improvements:
- Protected admin and metrics endpoints
- Account-level security for change orders
- Better 401/403 error handling
- Improved authorization checks throughout

 Common Questions

Q: What's the difference between a quote and an estimate?  
A: Both use the same interface. Estimates support contingency amounts for contractor flexibility. You can convert between types anytime.

Q: Do old quotes still work?  
A: Yes! All existing quotes work exactly as before. New features are available for all documents moving forward.

Q: Where do I create a quote or estimate?  
A: Navigate to "Quotes & Estimates" in the main menu. Click "Create New" and select the type.

Q: Can I convert a quote to an estimate after sending it?  
A: Yes! Open the quote and click "Convert to Estimate." You can add contingency amounts during conversion.

Q: How do change orders work with estimates?  
A: Create a change order and link it to the estimate, just like you would with an invoice. Track all scope changes from proposal phase.

Q: Do clients see contingency amounts?  
A: You control what appears in the PDF and client portal. Configure visibility in settings.

Q: Where are the PDFs generated?  
A: Click "Generate PDF" from any quote or estimate. Download or email directly from the app.

Q: Can clients approve estimates in the portal?  
A: Yes! Clients can view estimates and interact with them through their portal access.

 Troubleshooting

Can't find quotes & estimates menu: Check navigation menu - it may be labeled "Quotes & Estimates" now instead of just "Quotes."  
PDF generation fails: Check your internet connection and try again. PDFs generate server-side.  
Convert button missing: Only certain document states allow conversion. Check document status.  
Client can't see estimate: Verify client has portal access enabled and document is marked for sharing.
