Version: 1.5.0

---

 ✨ Overview

Every project evolves. Clients change their minds. Scopes expand. Requirements shift. And when that happens, you need a way to manage those changes professionally—without losing track of what was agreed upon, who approved what, or how much the changes cost.

That's why we're thrilled to introduce Change Orders in ProjectLedger v1.5.0.

This powerful new feature gives you complete control over project modifications, from the initial request to final approval and invoicing. Whether you're adding work to a project or removing items, Change Orders ensures every change is documented, approved by your client, and reflected accurately in your project financials.

No more handshake agreements that get forgotten. No more confusion about what was originally quoted versus what changed. Just clear, professional change management that protects both you and your clients.

 💡 What's New

 📋 Complete Change Order Management
Track every project modification from start to finish

Managing scope changes used to mean endless email threads, forgotten conversations, and disputes about what was actually agreed upon. Not anymore.

With Change Orders, you can create detailed modification requests that clearly show what's being added, removed, or changed in your project. Each change order references the original quote, calculates the financial impact automatically, and maintains a complete audit trail of every decision.

Why you'll love it:
- Crystal Clear Documentation — Every change is documented with line items, quantities, and prices
- Automatic Calculations — The system instantly calculates whether changes increase or decrease costs
- Protect Your Business — Never lose money on scope changes that weren't properly approved
- Client Transparency — Clients see exactly what's changing and what it costs before approving

How it works:
1. Open an accepted quote and click "Create Change Order"
2. Add new items, modify existing ones, or remove work from the project
3. Review the financial impact (additive or deductive)
4. Send to your client for approval
5. Track the approval status and execute when approved

 ✅ Client Approval Workflow
Get client sign-off quickly and securely

Getting client approval for changes shouldn't require printing documents, scanning signatures, or chasing people down. ProjectLedger's approval workflow makes it effortless.

When you send a change order to your client, they receive a professional email with a secure approval link. They can review the changes, see the financial impact, and approve or decline—all without needing to log in or download anything.

Why it matters:
- Fast Approvals — Clients can approve changes in seconds from any device
- Secure Process — Token-based authentication ensures only the right people can approve
- Email Notifications — Both you and your client receive confirmation when decisions are made
- Professional Image — Shows clients you run a organized, modern business

How it works:
1. Click "Send for Approval" on your change order
2. Client receives a professional email with change order details
3. Client clicks the approval link (no login required)
4. Client reviews changes and approves or declines
5. You receive instant notification of their decision

 📄 Professional PDF Generation
Share beautiful, branded change order documents

Every change order can be exported as a professional PDF that includes your branding, all the change details, financial impact summary, and approval information.

These PDFs are perfect for your records, client files, and accounting purposes. They look great, contain all the critical information, and can be saved or shared instantly.

What's included:
- Company Branding — Your logo and business information
- Complete Item Breakdown — All additions, modifications, and removals

 📊 Financial Impact Tracking
Know exactly how changes affect your bottom line

Every change order automatically calculates whether it's additive (increasing costs), deductive (decreasing costs), or neutral. You can see at a glance how changes impact your project profitability.

The system tracks:
- Original quote total
- New total after changes
- Net change amount (delta)
- Item-by-item cost breakdown

Why it's powerful:
- Protect Your Margins — Never accidentally undercharge for added work
- Transparency — Clients appreciate seeing the math clearly
- Project Insights — Understand how often and why projects change
- Better Estimates — Learn from historical change patterns

This audit trail is invaluable for:
- Dispute Resolution — Prove what was agreed upon and when
- Compliance — Meet regulatory and contract requirements
- Project Analysis — Understand your change order patterns
- Team Accountability — Track who's handling what

 📈 Integrated Reporting
